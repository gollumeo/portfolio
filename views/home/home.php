                technology that
                was sparked when I was just 14 years old. Over the past <span class="text-orange-500 font-semibold">12 years</span>,

            <p class="my-6 text-base xl:text-lg">Prior to my foray into the tech industry, I spent two years at
                university studying French law and
                improving my English language skills. I then gained valuable experience in the transport, logistics, and
                international trades field, holding several roles including road operator, customer service
                representative, freight forwarder, air freight forwarder, and project manager.</p>
